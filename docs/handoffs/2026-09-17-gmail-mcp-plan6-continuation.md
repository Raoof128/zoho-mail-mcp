# Gmail MCP Plan 6 continuation handoff

Updated 2026-09-17. This file contains implementation history and safe continuation instructions. It contains no credentials, tokens, email contents, target secrets, or private topology.

## Repository state

- Repository: `/Users/raoof.r12/Desktop/Raouf/gmail`
- Branch: `plan5-recovery`
- Worktree at handoff: clean
- Latest commit: `55b7c45 feat(qualification): verify v2 deployment and account identity`
- Previous related commit: `75f2e2b feat(qualification): resolve intents from durable mutation results`

## Implemented work

Plan 6 contracts, private artifacts, v2 runner/CLI refusal paths, durable intent consumption, restart-safe component outcomes, native receipt identity checks, full captured legacy writer execution, dependent intent resolution, durable result projections, and read-only v2 platform identity checks are implemented.

The dependent-intent path resolves only declared fields from earlier slots in the same preparation. It checks the exact source hash, preparation commitment, template, tool, sample, slot, target, timestamps, and durable consumption record. It rejects literal replacement, overlapping or unsafe paths, sparse arrays, unknown projection fields, changed effective envelopes, expiry, and replay after consumption.

`verifyTargetV2` checks deployment routing, version ETag, configuration bindings, schema markers, account status and credential version, sender identity, installation generation, health headers, and authorization expiry before and after reads. It is read-only and does not assert cross-host exclusion.

## Verification evidence

- `npm run verify`: passed 689 tests (shared 11, Worker 562, companion 9, qualification 107).
- Planning contract checker: 28 passed with strict TypeScript validation.
- SQLite conformance: 18 passed.
- Legacy writer corpus regeneration check: passed; all 136 captured sites are accounted for.
- Native evidence from the preceding checkpoint: 18 tests and release build passed. Native code did not change in the latest checkpoint.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

## Open Plan 6 work

Production controllers and positive mode-to-enable wiring remain incomplete. Sacrificial-target dependent intents, mutation-bearing preparation closure, complete administration interruption handling, full upload transaction/race acceptance, resource controller, provider controller, transfer/reply/revoke controller, restore integration, and complete release assessment remain open.

Three feasibility gates remain explicitly open:

1. Provider barrier: no supported mechanism has been shown to isolate a Gmail provider commit from a Worker receipt on the exact deployed artifact without changing that artifact's identity.
2. Writer quiescence and deployment exclusion: the local lock and D1 restore behavior do not prove that delayed or cross-host old writers cannot issue later writes.
3. Peak memory: Cloudflare invocation metrics use sampled memory observations and do not establish complete peak-isolate coverage for the required maximum-payload serial and concurrent runs.

These gates must remain refusal paths. Do not replace them with operator booleans, elapsed timeouts, successful requests, Node RSS, or mocked receipts.

## Cloudflare and client setup status

The user supplied a Cloudflare token from `/Users/raoof.r12/Desktop/Raouf/Portfolio/.env`. The token verifies as active but is IP restricted. Cloudflare returned error `9109`: this machine used `<redacted-ip>`, while the token allowed `<redacted-ip>`. Add the current machine IP to the token restriction while retaining the existing address, or provide a new private token-file path. Do not print or commit the token.

The token's current API calls return HTTP 401/403 for Workers and account discovery. Wrangler authentication can see two accounts, but neither exposes an accessible `gmail-mcp` deployment. No live Worker hostname, account ID, deployment receipt, target manifest, or operation authorization is available.

`worker/.dev.vars` has Google OAuth field names but placeholder values, and `OWNER_GOOGLE_SUBS` is empty. A real Google OAuth Web application client and owner identity must be configured before login. Do not place Cloudflare or Google secrets in Claude/Codex MCP configuration.

Claude Code and Codex are installed. Neither has a Gmail MCP entry yet. Configure them only after a real HTTPS Worker endpoint exists:

```bash
codex mcp add gmail-mcp --url https://<worker-host>/mcp
claude mcp add --transport http gmail-mcp https://<worker-host>/mcp
```

The user must complete OAuth in the browser and approve the intended Gmail account. A local `wrangler dev` endpoint cannot complete this repository's HTTPS audience and origin checks.

## Safe next actions

1. Verify the Cloudflare token from the allowed client IP and identify the intended account and Worker hostname.
2. Confirm the repository's effective deployment configuration privately; generate a build identity only from clean production inputs.
3. Deploy only with explicit target authorization, then write a private deployment receipt and run `verifyTargetV2`.
4. Configure Claude and Codex with the HTTPS `/mcp` endpoint and complete OAuth.
5. Keep live sends, restore, revocation, device trials, and mode enablement closed until their specific authorization and evidence gates are present.
