# Gmail MCP for Claude: design

Date: 2026-09-09 (revision 4, amended 2026-09-10 during plan 2 implementation)
Status: approved design, pre-implementation
Owner: Raouf

## 0. Problem and goal

The hosted Claude Gmail connector exposes 29 tools but none that returns attachment bytes. `get_message` returns attachment names and IDs only. Sending accepts attachments only as base64 inlined in the tool call, which is unusable beyond a few hundred kilobytes. Hosted connectors from any vendor change capability without notice, so this spec makes no product-versus-product claims.

Target: a remote Gmail MCP with attachment staging, local filesystem integration, multi-account operation, and server-enforced policy controls that do not depend on any capability of any hosted connector.

Goals:

1. Runs on Cloudflare so it works from claude.ai, Claude Desktop and Claude Code.
2. Downloads attachments to the owner's disk and attaches files from disk through a thin local companion.
3. Several Google accounts for one owner.
4. Tool parity with the hosted connector baseline captured in Appendix A, plus attachment and control tools.
5. Every Gmail mutation sits behind an editable, action-based `allow | ask | deny` policy that the server enforces. `ask` produces a human approval that no model can forge.

Non-goals for v1: multi-user tenancy, Google app verification and CASA, archive content scanning, Gmail permanent delete, downloading individual attachments larger than 25 MB, batch label or trash tools.

```

Rules:

- The Worker is the source of truth. Credentials, account selection, policy, approvals, operations, audit and attachment metadata live there.
- The companion knows nothing about Gmail. It moves bytes between staging handles and the filesystem and enforces the filesystem rules only it can enforce. Its uploads still pass through the Worker's policy engine (3.6).
- Gmail never talks to the companion. Attachments cross the boundary only through staging handles.
- Claude is not the authority. The MCP client is not the authority. Tool annotations are not the authority. The authenticated Worker policy engine is the authority.

Dated observation, not a design dependency: on 2026-09-09 the connector docs listed advanced capabilities as unsupported on claude.ai and Desktop. The design keys on advertised capabilities (1.4), never on product names.

### 1.3 Accounts

Each Google account gets an owner-chosen alias (`personal`, `university`, `work`), lower-case ASCII, unique per owner. Every write tool and `stage_file` require an explicit `account`. Read tools accept an optional `account` and fall back to the configured default. The model never guesses an account for a write.

### 1.4 Confirmation model

`ask` never means "do it and tell the user". It creates a pending action and returns without touching Gmail. Approval happens one of two ways:

1. **URL-mode elicitation** when the negotiated client capabilities include `elicitation.url` on protocol revision 2026-07-28. Amended 2026-09-10 (plan 3): the `agents` handler serves 2025-era clients through a stateless lane in which the server cannot send a request to the client, so those clients always receive path 2. The client opens the approval page and immediately retries the `tools/call` with an accept response. Per the spec the server may then block until the out-of-band approval completes: the Worker polls the pending row every 2 seconds for up to 120 seconds. If the row becomes `approved`, the Worker claims and executes in that same request and returns the real result. If it is still `pending` at the deadline, the Worker returns the ordinary `pending_approval` result (2.6) so the owner can finish in the browser and Claude can call `execute_pending` later. Declined or expired rows return an error.
2. **Approval URL in the tool result** otherwise. The owner opens it, approves in the browser, then Claude calls `execute_pending(id)`.

Both paths land on the same Worker page, which requires a browser session whose identity matches the pending row's owner. A model-relayed confirmation code is not an accepted approval path for any write.

Plan 4 amendment (2026-09-12): V1 refuses overwrite under every client. Approval-based overwrite is deferred as P4-OVERWRITE.

### 1.5 Threat model

In scope: malicious email content and prompt injection, malicious model output, stolen approval URL, cross-account confused deputy, replayed MCP calls, malicious OAuth client registration, CSRF, OAuth mix-up, stolen `mcp` bearer, stolen `staging` bearer, path traversal, symlink escape, network interruption, Worker crash mid-operation, duplicate delivery, malicious filenames and MIME headers, bidi and control characters in displayed text.

Out of scope: compromised local OS, compromised browser session, compromised Google account, compromised Cloudflare account or root secrets, Google or Cloudflare infrastructure compromise.

### 1.6 Honest bounds

- The approval page defeats model-initiated and injection-initiated writes. It does not defend against a compromised browser session.
- The server policy engine is the only enforcement layer. Client-side annotations are hints.
- Google app verification is out of scope. 4.4 explains how the deployment avoids the 7-day treadmill and what the personal-use exemption covers.
- Blocked-type checking is by filename. Gmail's scanner is authoritative.

## 2. Tool surface and action taxonomy

### 2.1 Actions and default policy

Policy keys on actions, not tool names. Values are `allow | ask | deny`.

| Action                    | Meaning                                                  | Default                        |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `read.search`             | search threads                                           | allow                          |
| `read.message`            | get message, thread, drafts, labels, attachment metadata | allow                          |
| `read.attachment`         | fetch attachment bytes into staging                      | allow                          |
| `draft.write`             | create or update a draft                                 | allow                          |
| `send.message`            | send new mail or reply                                   | ask                            |
| `send.draft`              | send an existing draft                                   | ask                            |
| `send.forward`            | forward an existing message                              | ask                            |
| `label.manage`            | create, update, delete label definitions                 | ask                            |
| `label.apply`             | add or remove labels on a message or thread              | allow                          |
| `spam.mark`               | mark spam                                                | ask                            |
| `spam.unmark`             | unmark spam                                              | allow                          |
| `trash.move`              | trash                                                    | ask                            |
| `trash.restore`           | untrash                                                  | allow                          |
| `attachment.stage_upload` | upload a local file into staging                         | ask                            |
| `fs.save`                 | write staged bytes to disk (companion-enforced)          | allow                          |
| `account.read`            | list accounts and their health                           | allow                          |
| `account.connect`         | connect or reconnect a Google account                    | ask, completes in browser only |
| `policy.read`             | read effective policy                                    | allow                          |
| `policy.edit`             | change policy                                            | browser only, no MCP tool      |

Effective level: account override, else owner global, else default above.

### 2.2 Modifiers

Each modifier raises the effective level one step: `allow` becomes `ask`; `ask` and `deny` are unchanged. Modifiers never lower a level.

| Modifier      | Applies to    | Trigger                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `+attachment` | `send.*`      | any attachment present, including a draft's existing attachments |
| `+external`   | `send.*`      | any recipient outside the trusted set (2.8)                      |
| `+bulk`       | `send.*`      | more than 10 distinct recipients across To, Cc and Bcc           |
| `+sensitive`  | `label.apply` | target is a sensitive or system label                            |
| `+overwrite`  | `fs.save`     | destination file exists                                          |

Label, trash and spam tools act on one message or thread per call in v1, so `+bulk` does not apply to them. Batch tools are a deferred item (6).

There is no permanent delete tool, and the requested Google scope cannot perform one.

### 2.3 Remote tools (38)

Names mirror the hosted connector baseline (Appendix A) where one exists. Amended 2026-09-10 (plan 3): every tool argument is snake_case, matching `page_token` and `body_char_limit` in the rows below. The seven control tools (`list_accounts`, `get_policy`, `list_pending`, `execute_pending`, `cancel_pending`, `connect_account`, `open_policy_editor`) read the owner's own state or are the approval mechanism itself and do not pass through the policy engine; the 31 Gmail tools do.

Every read result echoes `account`. Message, thread, draft and attachment identifiers are account-bound: a lookup includes `account_id` and `user_id` in the query, never as a post-check, and the schema enforces the pairing (3.2).

### 2.4 Companion tools (3)

Plan 4 amendment (2026-09-12): the reviewed [companion design](../plans/2026-09-11-gmail-mcp-plan-4-companion-and-staging.md) supersedes the original path and ticket model.

| Tool              | Action                  | Inputs and behavior                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `save_attachment` | fs.save                 | `handle`, `root`, `path`. Validate a relative destination, verify bytes, publish exclusively, journal the inode and ACK. V1 refuses overwrite.                            |
| `stage_file`      | attachment.stage_upload | `account`, `root`, `path`, `mime`, optional `idempotency_key`. Snapshot before approval, then create or recover the same owner-bound transfer. Maximum 25 MiB, inclusive. |
| `list_roots`      | read                    | Logical root IDs and read/write permissions; no absolute paths in results.                                                                                                |

Configuration lives in owner-only `~/.config/gmail-mcp/config.json`. SQLite receipts and snapshots live under `~/Library/Application Support/gmail-mcp/`, outside granted roots. The native helper accesses Keychain through Security.framework and serializes cross-process work with a permanent lock file.

Blocked extensions: `GMAIL_BLOCKED_EXTENSION_SET`, configuration seeded from Google's published list (about 50 entries including `exe dll bat cmd js jse vbs msi jar apk appx iso ps1 mjs msix lnk vhd xll`). Checked by filename on uploads at stage time and again at send time. Downloads to disk are sanitised but not filtered by this list, since it describes what Gmail refuses to send, not what the owner may save. Archives are not inspected.

### 2.8 Recipient trust rules for `+external`

- Addresses are parsed with a real RFC 5322 address parser. A malformed address fails the call before policy.
- Address comparison: local part and domain compared after the domain is lower-cased and converted to ASCII (Punycode). Gmail `+tag` suffixes are stripped for comparison. Dots in the local part are not normalised.
- Domain pattern `@example.com` matches `a@example.com` and nothing else. It does not match `a@evil-example.com` or `a@sub.example.com`.
- The trusted set is evaluated over the union of To, Cc and Bcc.
- Consumer Gmail account: trusted = the account's own address, its configured send-as aliases, and the allowlist.
- Workspace account: trusted = the above plus addresses whose domain is in `org_domains`.

## 3. Data model, confirmation engine, operations, tokens, staging

### 3.1 Identity root

`user_id` is the `sub` from the Worker's own OAuth token. It is never read from tool arguments.

### 3.2 D1 schema

Foreign keys are enforced. Every child table binds `(user_id, account_id)` to `accounts(user_id, id)` so ownership is a database invariant, not a query habit.

```sql

```

OAuth `state`, the OIDC `nonce` and pending consent requests live in D1:

```sql
oauth_states (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  kind TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (kind IN ('login','reauth','connect','authreq')),
  payload TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL, expires_at INTEGER NOT NULL, consumed_at INTEGER
);
```

They are consumed by one atomic `UPDATE ... SET consumed_at = ? WHERE id = ? AND kind = ? AND consumed_at IS NULL AND expires_at > ? RETURNING payload`; zero rows means unknown, expired or replayed. Workers KV is eventually consistent and a `get` followed by a `delete` is not a one-use consume, so KV holds only `workers-oauth-provider` state (client registrations, grants, its tokens). `accounts` carries `credential_version INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0`: every write that stores or refreshes Google credentials is conditional on it and on `status = 'active'`, and revocation is local-first, bumping the version before Google is told. CSRF tokens are not stored anywhere (4.6).

### 3.3 Token encryption and refresh

- Keyring: Worker secret `TOKEN_KEKS` is a JSON object `{ "<key_id>": "<base64 32 bytes>", … }`; secret `TOKEN_KEK_CURRENT` names the key used for new writes. Old keys stay in the ring until every ciphertext using them has been re-encrypted, which happens lazily on next use, per ciphertext (`*_key_id` columns).
- AES-256-GCM via WebCrypto, fresh 12-byte IV, stored as `iv || ciphertext || tag`.
- AAD is canonically framed: `"gmail-mcp:v1" \0 user_id \0 account_id \0 field_name`.
- Access tokens are cached encrypted with expiry. On `invalid_grant`, the account flips to `needs_reconnect`; the next tool call on that account returns a URL-mode elicitation to `/connect?alias=…`.
- Tokens never appear in tool results, audit rows or logs.

### 3.4 Canonical arguments and the confirmation state machine

Canonicalisation: arguments are schema-validated, defaults applied, inline attachments converted to staging handles, then serialised with RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme. `payload_hash = sha256(canonical bytes)`. The implementation ships test vectors.

```
pending ─approve(elicitation|browser)─▶ approved ─claim─▶ executing ─▶ executed
   │                                       │                   └─▶ failed
   ├─ decline ─▶ denied                    └─ ttl ─▶ expired
   ├─ cancel_pending ─▶ cancelled
   └─ ttl 15 min ─▶ expired
```

Invariants:

- **Payload is server-held.** The `ask`-hit call stores canonical arguments as `payload_json`. The approval page renders from the row. Later model output cannot change what executes.
- **Approval binds identity.** Browser approval requires a `web_sessions` row whose `user_id` equals the pending row's. Elicitation approval carries an HMAC-signed `requestState` (secret `STATE_HMAC_KEY`) with `version="gmail-mcp:approval:v1"`, `pending_id`, `user_id`, `account_id`, `payload_hash`, `expires_at`, `nonce`, verified against the bearer token on the retried call. Amended 2026-09-10 (plan 3): the state is minted by the SDK's `createRequestStateCodec` with `STATE_HMAC_KEY`, bound to the owner and the request method, and verified by the SDK before the handler runs; the payload is `{ v, tool, pending_id, account_id, intent_hash }` and the expiry equals the pending TTL. A `nonce` is not carried: the pending id is single-claim and the state is bound to one owner, so a replay has nothing to gain.
- **The payload names its executor.** Amended 2026-09-10 (plan 3): every stored payload carries `tool` and `v`, the executor version it was approved for. A pending row whose version no longer matches the registered executor is `payload_mismatch` and never runs.
- **Resume re-hashes.** The retried `tools/call` arguments are canonicalised and compared to `payload_hash`. Mismatch is denied and audited.
- **Claim is one atomic batch.** D1 `batch()` runs its statements as one transaction and rolls back the whole sequence if any statement errors, but it does not roll back on a zero-row update. The claim therefore uses an assertion table `_assert (x INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (x = 0))` to convert a failed precondition into an error. Statement order, all in one batch: (1) `INSERT INTO operations (id, …, state='claimed', payload_hash)`; (2) `UPDATE pending_actions SET state='executing', operation_id=?, executed_at=? WHERE id=? AND user_id=? AND state='approved' AND expires_at > ?`; (3) `INSERT INTO _assert SELECT 1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pending_actions WHERE id=? AND operation_id=? AND state='executing')`; (4) reserve staging handles (3.7); (5) `INSERT INTO _assert SELECT 1 WHERE (SELECT count(*) FROM staging_objects WHERE reserved_by_operation_id=?) != ?`. Statements 3 and 5 insert a row only when the precondition failed, the CHECK rejects it, and the batch rolls back including the operation row. Zero rows in statement 2 means replayed, expired or never approved. Foreign keys are immediate, which is why the operation row is inserted before the pending row references it.
- **Policy is re-evaluated at claim.** A tighter policy saved between approval and execution wins.
- **One approval covers one action.**
- **Terminal purge.** On any terminal state `payload_json` is set to NULL and `summary` replaced by a redacted form. The linked operation, not the pending row, carries delivery state from here on. Amended 2026-09-10 (plan 3): a pending row whose operation ends `delivery_unknown` is finished as `failed` with `error = "delivery_unknown"`, and the operation is authoritative for delivery from then on.

### 3.5 Operations: every external mutation gets a journal row

`operations` is the journal of non-idempotent external side effects. An operation exists whether or not the caller supplied an `idempotency_key`. The key is a secondary uniqueness constraint used only to short-circuit retries.

Journaled actions: `send.message`, `send.draft`, `send.forward`, `draft.write` (create and update), `label.manage` (create only). Label apply, trash, spam and updates are naturally reconcilable and are not journaled. Amended 2026-09-10 (plan 3): journaling is chosen per tool, not per action, so `label.manage` journals `create_label` and not `update_label` or `delete_label`, and `draft.write` journals both of its tools because reserving an upload handle needs an operation row to reserve it for, and one execution path for every draft write is safer than two.

Execution of a journaled action:

1. **Acquire.** If an `idempotency_key` is present and a row already exists: `executed` returns the stored result without calling Gmail; `executing`, `claimed` or `delivery_unknown` returns `delivery_unknown` without calling Gmail; `failed_safe` allows a fresh operation. `ask` actions use the pending id as the key. Otherwise insert a new `claimed` row. Amended 2026-09-10 (plan 3): keys live in `idempotency_keys`, recorded against the hash of the client's intent (the arguments, with inline attachment bytes replaced by their digest) before staging and before the allow/ask fork. A key follows its pending action or operation; a `failed_safe` operation or a dead pending action releases it. `executed` replays the stored result (ids only); anything in flight answers `delivery_unknown`; a live pending action is returned again.
2. **Reserve** attachments (3.7), move to `executing`.
3. **Send.** For new messages and replies: generate `rfc822_message_id` (`<op_…@<worker hostname>>`), set `Message-ID`, build MIME as a stream (3.8). Set the operation to `executing` immediately before the request to Google is opened, not earlier, so a stale `claimed` row is provably free of side effects. Upload via media upload when the MIME is 5 MB or smaller, resumable upload otherwise. Amended 2026-09-10 (plan 3): resumable upload is used as a transport with an exact `Content-Length`, without session recovery: the session URL is not persisted and an interrupted PUT is not resumed. Opening the session moves no bytes and is retried like a read; the operation moves to `executing` immediately before the PUT. Recovery is Plan 5's, alongside reconciliation. A multipart upload carries the thread id with the bytes when a reply must land in an existing thread. For `send_draft`: read the draft's message id and thread id, then call `drafts.send`.
4. **Record.** On success write `gmail_result_id`, state `executed`, consume reserved handles. Amended 2026-09-10 (plan 3): every local consequence of one Gmail result (operation state and stored result, reservations, the pending row, the outcome audit row) is one D1 batch.
5. **Crash or ambiguity.** If Gmail may have received the request body and no definitive response was recorded, the row stays `executing`. The cron promotes `executing` rows older than 2 minutes to `delivery_unknown` and `claimed` rows older than 2 minutes to `failed_safe` (no request was ever opened). Reserved handles stay reserved on `delivery_unknown` and are released on `failed_safe`.
6. **Reconciliation.** For messages sent with our `Message-ID`, search `rfc822msgid:<id>`; if found, mark `executed`. For `send_draft`, list `SENT` messages in the recorded thread newer than the operation start. Gmail search indexing can lag, so the cron retries reconciliation on each run for up to 24 hours before leaving the row `delivery_unknown` for the owner. Automatic reconciliation is enabled only after the Message-ID preservation test (4.7) passes. Until then `delivery_unknown` is surfaced to the owner and never auto-retried:

```json
{
  "status": "delivery_unknown",
  "operation_id": "op_…",
  "message": "The Gmail request may have succeeded. Do not retry automatically."
}
```

There is no content-based dedupe. Identical content sent twice on purpose is two operations.

### 3.6 Upload policy path (companion to Worker)

Plan 4 amendment (2026-09-12): authenticate to `/staging/identity`, persist a private snapshot and owner/origin/client-scoped request key, then call `POST /staging/intent` with `{mode, transfer_id, account, metadata}`. `ensure` creates or recovers authority; `status` reads it; `retry` additionally requires `expected_generation` and a durable `retry_request_id`.

`ask` creates one pending action without accepting bytes. Browser approval permits issuance under that same intent. Generic MCP `execute_pending` refuses staging actions before claim. The companion supports modern URL input requests, legacy URL elicitation, and a text-link fallback. A client response cannot substitute for Worker approval.

Ticket IDs are identifiers, not credentials. PUT requires the staging OAuth bearer and the current owner-bound generation. The Worker checks headers, length, SHA-256, account credential version and lease, then publishes one handle in the completion batch. Replays return the original result; they do not create new objects. Retrying an expired or interrupted generation requires a subsequent tool invocation and remains bound to the original snapshot and authority deadline.

Use the exact deadlines, quotas and recovery rules in [Plan 4 sections 6–8](../plans/2026-09-11-gmail-mcp-plan-4-companion-and-staging.md). Expired leases fence publication; unknown writers keep their cleanup charge.

### 3.7 Staging handle lifecycle

Handle: `sh_` plus 32 random bytes base64url. Non-enumerable, carries no Google identifiers.

Ingest validates before it writes. The body is materialised and hashed first, bounded by the 25 MB cap against a 128 MB isolate, so no failure path can orphan an object. Streaming straight into R2 was tried and rejected: a wrong declared length aborts the in-flight upload, leaves a partial object, and surfaces as an unhandled rejection.

Download: `download_attachment` first reads the part's `size` from message metadata and refuses anything above 25 MB before any bytes move. It then calls `attachments.get`, which returns JSON with base64url `data`. V1 buffers the response (at most about 34 MB of text plus 25 MB decoded, within the 128 MB isolate), decodes, hashes the decoded bytes and writes them to R2, then writes the row with `expires_at = now + 30 min`. The 25 MB Worker round-trip test in 4.7 is an implementation gate for this choice. The companion GET requires a staging bearer and an atomic owner-bound download lease. After durable exclusive publication, ACK records consumption and an independent seven-day tombstone. Repeated ACK returns success without requiring the original staging row.

Hold at pending creation: when an `ask` action references upload handles, the same request extends each referenced handle's `expires_at` to the pending row's `expires_at` plus 5 minutes, so a handle staged 29 minutes earlier cannot expire between approval and execution.

Reservation at send: inside the claim batch, `UPDATE staging_objects SET reserved_by_operation_id=? WHERE handle IN (…) AND user_id=? AND account_id=? AND direction='upload' AND consumed_at IS NULL AND reserved_by_operation_id IS NULL AND expires_at > ?`; the batch fails unless the row count equals the handle count. `executed` consumes; `failed_safe` releases; `delivery_unknown` keeps the reservation until reconciled or expired.

Purge: cron every 5 minutes expires stale pending rows, promotes stuck `executing` operations, deletes expired unreserved staging objects from R2 and D1, and deletes audit rows older than 90 days. An R2 lifecycle rule on `stg/` deleting objects one day after creation is the eventual backstop.

### 3.8 MIME and header safety

- MIME is built by `worker/src/mime/`, the one module that serialises headers, with RFC 2047 and RFC 2231 encoders that ship test vectors, every header folded under 78 characters and asserted under 998. Amended 2026-09-10 (plan 3): `mimetext` 3.0.28 was measured to emit attachment filenames raw inside quotes and was rejected. The message is a pull-based stream with an exact length: attachments are read from R2 one chunk at a time, so the isolate never holds a 25 MB attachment, its base64 and the message at once.
- Subject, recipient display names, attachment filenames and aliases are rejected if they contain CR, LF or NUL. Non-ASCII header values use RFC 2047 encoding; filenames use RFC 2231.
- Local filenames written by the companion: basename only, no `/`, `\`, `..` or NUL, NFC-normalised, Unicode control and bidi characters replaced with `_`.
- Anywhere the approval page shows attacker-influenced text, bidi and control characters are rendered as visible escapes.

### 3.10 Audit semantics

Two rows per mutating call: an `intent` row before any external side effect (tool, action, modifiers, decision), and an `outcome` row after. Read calls and denials write one `intent` row only. The operation journal, not the audit log, is authoritative for delivery. If the outcome write fails after Gmail succeeded, the tool still returns `executed` and the failure is reported to telemetry. Metadata only: no bodies, no full subjects, no tokens. Readable through `/audit`, never through an MCP tool.

| --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Claude clients  | `mcp`          | `/mcp` only                                                         | Flow A            |
| Companion       | `staging`      | `/staging/*` only                                                   | Flow C            |
| Owner's browser | session cookie | `/approve`, `/policy`, `/accounts`, `/audit`, `/connect`, `/logout` | Google OIDC login |

Per-client allowed scopes are enforced by our authorization handler, since the library does not: the pre-registered `companion` client may receive only `staging`; CIMD and DCR clients may receive only `mcp`; a request for any other combination is rejected before consent. Every API route also checks the token's scope and RFC 8707 audience. Google Gmail refresh tokens are held only by the Worker (Flow B).

### 4.2 Flow A: Claude to Worker

- `OAuthProvider` with `clientIdMetadataDocumentEnabled: true`, `allowPlainPKCE: false`, `resourceMetadata.resource` set to the canonical `/mcp` URL, and the `global_fetch_strictly_public` compatibility flag. It mounts `/authorize`, `/token`, `/register` and serves both well-known documents.
- Registration: Claude clients use CIMD when they offer it, DCR as deprecated compatibility. The companion is pre-registered. This matches the library's stated preference order.
- Redirect URIs: exact scheme, host and path match against the client's own registration. Loopback clients vary the port per RFC 8252 §7.3. The claude.ai client's registered URI is `https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback`. Claude Code registers `http://localhost:PORT/callback` (and used `127.0.0.1` in one release), so both loopback hosts are accepted for its registration. No wildcard allowlist exists.
- Consent page per Cloudflare guidance: sanitised client name and redirect URI, CSRF token, approved-clients cookie. Then Google OIDC with `openid email profile` only, `state` and one-use `nonce` in KV. On return verify `id_token` signature, `iss`, `aud`, `exp`, `nonce`, `email_verified == true`, and `iat` within the last 10 minutes with 60 s of clock tolerance. The remembered-consent cookie is bound to the owner's `sub`, so a different owner in the same browser always sees the consent page. Require `sub ∈ OWNER_GOOGLE_SUBS`. Complete the grant with `props = { sub, email }`.
- Bootstrap: when `OWNER_GOOGLE_SUBS` is empty and `email ∈ OWNER_EMAILS`, the setup page displays the `sub` to paste into the secret and asks the owner to confirm the identity first, because for a non-Gmail, non-Workspace address `email_verified` means Google confirmed the address once, not that it remains authoritative. `OWNER_EMAILS` is consulted only while `OWNER_GOOGLE_SUBS` is empty, and it never grants a session.
- Profile-only scopes exempt this identity login from the 7-day Testing expiry.

### 4.3 Flow B: Worker to Google per account

- Entry: `connect_account(alias)` returns URL-mode elicitation to `/connect?alias=…&e=<signed elicitation id>`, or the Accounts page. `/connect` requires a session whose `user_id` matches.
- Scopes: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify` plus `openid email`. `mail.google.com` is never requested, so permanent deletion is impossible at the scope level as well as the tool level.
- `access_type=offline`, `prompt=consent`, `state` and `nonce` in KV bound to a hash of the session id, 600 s TTL.
- Callback: verify `state`, exchange code, verify `id_token`, upsert `accounts` on `(user_id, google_sub)`, fetch verified send-as addresses into `send_as`, encrypt tokens, audit `account.connect`. Revoke calls Google's revocation endpoint, wipes ciphertexts, marks `revoked`.

### 4.4 Google Cloud projects

| Project              | Publishing status                                 | Used by                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gmail-mcp-dev`      | Testing                                           | scratch Gmail account, integration tests. 7-day refresh expiry accepted, so the protected suite is manual only, run after a fresh consent |
| `gmail-mcp-personal` | In production, unverified, personal-use exemption | the owner's real accounts                                                                                                                 |

The verification and CASA exclusion holds only while this remains a personal-use system under 100 users known to the owner. General distribution changes the requirement: server-side storage of restricted-scope data then requires a third-party security assessment.

### 4.5 Flow C: Companion to Worker

`gmail-mcp-companion login` runs PKCE against the Worker's AS as the pre-registered public client `companion`, redirect `http://127.0.0.1:<ephemeral>/callback`, same Google OIDC identity step, token scope `staging` only. The native helper stores access and refresh tokens in macOS Keychain through Security.framework, with no secrets in argv or environment. A persisted epoch fences logout against older login commits. Staging routes check the bearer's `sub` against `staging_objects.user_id` inside the query.

### 4.6 Web pages and session security

Server-rendered HTML forms, no client JavaScript, no third-party assets.

`form-action` names Google because browsers apply the directive to the redirect that follows a form post, and `/reauth` and `/connect` answer a post with a redirect to Google. The consent page adds the client's own redirect origin the same way. `/reauth` is a POST so it sits behind CSRF like every other state change.

The approval page renders a typed view per action family: recipients kept apart as To, Cc and Bcc for sends, target ids and counts for trash, spam and label actions, the label operation for label management, and the file for an upload. A payload whose shape has no view is printed in full, so nothing is ever approved blind. Trust-boundary settings on `/accounts` (recipient allowlist, organisation domains, raising the send limit, companion registration, revocation) require recent authentication and are audited as `policy.edit`. A policy edit and its audit row and the revocation of other sessions are one transaction, as are an approval decision and its audit row.

Session: `__Host-session` = 256-bit random opaque value; `web_sessions.id_hash` stores its sha256. HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax. Rotated after login. Absolute lifetime 12 h, idle timeout 2 h. Logout revokes immediately. Recent authentication means `authenticated_at` within the last 15 minutes; `last_seen_at` never counts. Policy edits and account revocations require recent authentication and revoke all other sessions.

CSRF: stateless per-form token = HMAC (secret `CSRF_HMAC_KEY`) over `session_id || method || route || object_id || expiry`, delivered in the form and recomputed on POST. A token for `/approve/A` cannot approve `/approve/B`.

Response headers on every page:

```
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; style-src 'self'; form-action 'self' https://accounts.google.com; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'none'
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

### 4.7 Testing matrix

**Normal CI (no real Gmail credentials)**

- Unit, Vitest in the Workers runtime via the Cloudflare vitest pool:
  - policy engine, table-driven over every action × level × modifier, including consumer vs Workspace `+external`, `+tag` stripping, Punycode domains, `@domain` boundary cases
  - state machine and operations: no sequence reaches `executed` twice; two concurrent claims yield one success; same idempotency key returns the first result and never calls the fake Gmail twice; global policy duplicate insert rejected; account and user FK mismatch rejected
  - crypto: decrypt fails on AAD mismatch, unknown key id, truncated ciphertext; keyring rotation re-encrypts lazily
  - handles: cross-account, cross-user, expired, reserved, ACK after TTL all rejected; same handle in two sends yields one reservation
  - argument limits: over-cap body, 501 recipients, 1 MB-plus inline attachments, 1 MB-plus canonical payload all rejected before any row is written
  - blocked extensions: every seeded entry rejected at intent and at send
  - MIME encoders: RFC 2047 words at most 75 characters, RFC 2231 continuations, header injection refused (added 2026-09-10, plan 3)
  - companion: traversal, symlink escape, all overwrites refused; sha mismatch deletes the temp file; bidi and control path components refused; upload proceeds only with a valid ticket
- Workers integration against a fake Gmail HTTP adapter: full tool round-trips, `ask` result shape, approval page POST, elicitation resume, `send_draft` path, media vs resumable upload selection at the 5 MB boundary, 25 MB MIME streamed without exceeding memory.
- **Fault injection** at each checkpoint, killing or throwing deliberately: operation inserted; pending action claimed; attachments reserved; MIME construction begins; Google request headers sent; Google request body partially sent; Google response received; before D1 success write; after D1 success write; before audit outcome write. For each, assert either no duplicate external side effect or `delivery_unknown` with no automatic retry.
- OAuth and web adversarial: redirect_uri substitution, authorization-code replay, `state` replay, `nonce` replay, issuer mix-up, wrong audience, expired `id_token`, session fixation, CSRF token from another pending action, open-redirect attempts, CIMD metadata tampering, a DCR client requesting `staging`, `mcp` token to `/staging`, `staging` token to `/mcp`, `execute_pending` replay, `requestState` field tampering one field at a time, retried elicitation call with changed recipients, approval URL opened under a different session, `last_seen_at` alone attempting a recent-auth action.

**Protected Gmail integration (manual pre-release only; never on forks)**

- Dedicated scratch Gmail account in `gmail-mcp-dev`, secret only in the protected environment, mailbox holds no real mail.
- Send with a staged attachment, fetch it back, sha256 matches.
- **Message-ID preservation gate**: send with a supplied `Message-ID`, search `rfc822msgid:`, must match. Reconciliation in 3.5 is enabled only if this passes.
- `send_draft` round-trip and its thread-based reconciliation.
- Revoke the token in Google; next call flips to `needs_reconnect` and returns a URL elicitation.
- **25 MB download and 25 MB send round-trips** within Workers Paid CPU and memory limits. This is the implementation gate for the buffering decision in 3.7.
- Reply threading: `reply` produces a message Gmail shows in the original thread.

**End to end**

- MCP Inspector against `/mcp` for auth and schemas.
- Claude Code: `ask` via native URL-mode elicitation; companion save, stage with `allow` and with `ask`.
- Claude Desktop: `ask` via approval link then `execute_pending`; companion save; overwrite refused.
- claude.ai: `ask` via approval link then `execute_pending`; no companion.

Every adversarial test records both outcomes. A caught abuse is evidence the gate works.

TypeScript for the Worker and companion protocol; Swift, Darwin C wrappers and SQLite for native authority. MCP and OAuth dependencies pinned to exact versions. Worker uses Cloudflare's MCP package and `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` >= 0.10.2. Companion uses the MCP TypeScript SDK 2.x over stdio.

## 6. Deferred (signed IOUs)

- Batch label, trash and spam tools, with `+bulk` applied to them.
- `search_threads(account="all")` fan-out across accounts.
- Companion as a full local proxy re-exposing every tool with path parameters (Approach B).
- Multi-user signup replacing `OWNER_GOOGLE_SUBS`.
- Gmail app verification and CASA.
- Streaming base64url extraction for downloads above 25 MB.

Retired: the `X-Claude-Audit-Id` header on sent mail. An internal audit id has no business travelling to recipients' mail servers.
